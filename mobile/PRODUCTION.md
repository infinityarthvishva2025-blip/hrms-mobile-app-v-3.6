The Android build has been successfully initiated! 🚀

Since we allowed Expo to manage the keystore, it automatically generated one and stored it securely in your EAS account. The eas build command successfully archived your project and uploaded it to the Expo servers.

You can monitor the live compilation and download the .aab production file directly from this link: View Build Progress on Expo

The API URLs were also successfully completely refactored. I am closing this task now!

✅ FIRST TIME PUBLISH (Step-by-Step)
✅ Step 1 — Make Sure Config Is Correct

Your app.json is already good:

"android": {
  "package": "com.infinityarthvishva.hrms",
  "versionCode": 1
}

Important:

Do NOT change package after publishing

versionCode must start from 1

✅ Step 2 — Install EAS CLI

If not installed:

npm install -g eas-cli

Login:

eas login
✅ Step 3 — Configure EAS

Run inside project:

eas build:configure

You already have eas.json ✅
So you’re ready.

✅ Step 4 — Let Expo Create & Manage Keystore

Run:

eas build -p android --profile production

It will ask:

Generate a new Android Keystore?

👉 Select YES

Now Expo:

Generates keystore

Stores it securely

Links it to your project

You don’t handle anything manually.

✅ Step 5 — Download AAB

After build finishes:

Download .aab file

Upload to Play Console → Production → Create Release

Done 🎉

🔄 HOW TO UPDATE APP LATER (VERY IMPORTANT)

This is simple.

Step 1 — Increase Version

Open app.json

Change:

"version": "1.0.1",
"android": {
  "versionCode": 2
}

Rules:

version → change every update (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)

versionCode → MUST increase (1 → 2 → 3 → 4)

If you don’t increase versionCode → Play Store rejects upload.

Step 2 — Build Again
eas build -p android --profile production

Expo will automatically:

Use same keystore

Sign correctly

Generate new AAB

No extra configuration needed.

Step 3 — Upload to Play Store

Play Console → Production → Create new release
Upload new .aab

Submit for review.

That’s it ✅

🔐 Where Is The Keystore Stored?

Expo stores it securely in:

Expo Servers (linked to your account)

You can verify with:

eas credentials

It will show:

Keystore: Managed by EAS
🚨 IMPORTANT SAFETY TIP

Even though Expo manages it:

You should download backup once:

eas credentials

Then download Android Keystore.

Store it safely.

🏢 For Your HRMS App (Infinity HRMS)

Before publishing:

✔ Make sure backend URL is production HTTPS
✔ Remove all console.log
✔ Disable development mode
✔ Add Privacy Policy URL
✔ Fill Data Safety form in Play Console

Google checks HR apps carefully.

🎯 Summary (Scenario 1)

First Time:

eas build -p android --profile production
→ Expo creates keystore
→ Upload AAB

Update:

Increase version + versionCode
eas build -p android --profile production
→ Upload new AAB



=================

🔄 STEP-BY-STEP: Upload Next Version to Play Store
✅ STEP 1 — Update Version in app.json

Open your app.json.

Current:

"version": "1.0.0",
"android": {
  "package": "com.infinityarthvishva.hrms",
  "versionCode": 1
}

Update it to:

"version": "1.0.1",
"android": {
  "package": "com.infinityarthvishva.hrms",
  "versionCode": 2
}
🔑 Important Rules
Field	What to Do
version	Change every update (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
versionCode	MUST increase (1 → 2 → 3 → 4…)
package	❌ NEVER change
Signing key	❌ NEVER change

If you forget to increase versionCode, Play Store will reject the upload.

✅ STEP 2 — Verify Production Settings

Before building, confirm:

✔ Backend API is production (NOT 192.168.x.x)
✔ No test console.logs
✔ App works in release mode
✔ No debug URLs

Since yours is an HRMS app, Google reviews carefully.

✅ STEP 3 — Build New Production AAB

Run:

eas build -p android --profile production

EAS will:

Use same package: com.infinityarthvishva.hrms

Use same signing key (automatically)

Generate new .aab

Download the AAB after build completes.

✅ STEP 4 — Upload to Play Console

Go to Play Console

Open Infinity HRMS

Go to:

Production → Create new release

Upload new .aab

Add release notes (example: “Bug fixes and performance improvements”)

Review

Submit for review

📌 What MUST Stay Consistent Every Update

These things should NEVER change:

1️⃣ Package Name
com.infinityarthvishva.hrms

If changed → Play Store treats it as a new app.

2️⃣ Signing Key

Expo automatically keeps same signing key.

If signing key changes → Play Store rejects update.

3️⃣ Application ID

Same as package name — must remain same.

🔄 Example Update Timeline
Version	version	versionCode
First release	1.0.0	1
Second release	1.0.1	2
Third release	1.0.2	3



versionCode always increases by +1 (or more).

🚨 Common Mistakes That Cause Rejection

❌ Forgot to increase versionCode
❌ Changed package name
❌ Changed signing key
❌ Uploading APK instead of AAB
❌ Backend still pointing to local IP

🧠 Optional (Recommended)

Before uploading update, test production build:

eas build -p android --profile preview

Install on real device and test everything.

🎯 Simple Update Checklist For You

For Infinity HRMS:

1️⃣ Change version + versionCode
2️⃣ Run eas build -p android --profile production
3️⃣ Download AAB
4️⃣ Upload to Play Console
5️⃣ Submit

Done.
